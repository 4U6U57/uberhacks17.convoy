## Inspiration

While organizing a night out or any outing for groups of people, it's not uncommon to be struggling to find just the right amount of Ubers, how to properly split the fairs, and ensure every ride arrives at the same destination at the same time.

Convoy is made to solve that problem, by being a fully text messaged based service to reduce the amount of confusion involved with event planning.

## What it does

The user queries a phone number registered with the Twilio service. From there, twilio provides a randomly generated word for other users in the group to text to twilio's provided number. A random user is chosen to open to the uber service to order a car for another 4 or 6 people in the group.
